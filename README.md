# closed-loop-sim
This is  the closed-loop system simulation application. The PID controller is used in order to control oscillator object. The user has the possibility to set the PID parameters and see final result, which is the system response on step signal, on a plot. The application was developed with Python using tkinter and matplot libraries and PyCharm IDE on Windows 10. It may also be run in Linux and Mac environment.
